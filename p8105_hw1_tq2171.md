# Problem 1

## load the dataset

``` r
# Load the 'penguins' dataset from the 'palmerpenguins' package
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

This is a dataset called “penguins”, it contains 344 observations and 8
variables, which means there are 344 rows and 8 columns. Name of the 8
variables are the following: species, island, bill_length_mm,
bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year. The type of
each variable are the following: species is factor, island is factor,
bill_length_mm is numeric, bill_depth_mm is numeric, flipper_length_mm
is integer, body_mass_g is integer, sex is factor, year is integer.
There are three variables that the type is factor, which are species,
island and the sex. For the variable species, it contains 3 levels
“Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap”, for the variable island, it contains 3
levels “Torgersen, Biscoe, Dream”, and for the variable sex, it contains
2 factors “male, female”. For the rest of the 5 variables, they are
either numeric or integer. Due to the variable flipper_length_mm
contains missing value, so when we calculate the mean of
flipper_length_mm, we need to drop the missing value, which use the
na.rm=TRUE, and after that, we can know the mean of flipper length is
200.9152047.

## make the scatterplot

``` r
# Load the ggplot2 library
library(ggplot2)

# Create a scatterplot
scatter_plot<-
  ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Bill Length vs Flipper Length", x = "bill_length_mm", y = "flipper_length_mm") +
  theme_minimal()
plot(scatter_plot)
```

    ## (`geom_point()`).

The mean calculation works for the numeric random sample and the logical
vector but fails for the character and factor vectors due to how R
handles different data types. The mean of the numeric random sample
works because the values are inherently numeric, allowing for
straightforward mathematical operations. Similarly, the mean of the
logical vector works because R automatically coerces logical values
(`TRUE` and `FALSE`) into numeric values (`1` and `0`), respectively,
making it possible to compute the mean as the proportion of `TRUE`
values. However, the mean calculation does not work for the character
vector because characters are text data that cannot be directly
converted into numbers; R does not know how to interpret or average text
strings. For the factor vector, while it is stored internally as
integers, it represents categorical data with associated levels. The
levels have meaning as categories, not as numeric values, so taking
their mean does not make sense and will not yield a meaningful result.

``` r
# Coerce logical vector to numeric
numeric_logical <- as.numeric(df$logical_vector)

# Coerce character vector to numeric
numeric_character <- as.numeric(df$character_vector)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
# Coerce factor vector to numeric
numeric_factor <- as.numeric(df$factor_vector)
```

The `as.numeric()` function in R successfully converts logical vectors
and factor vectors to numeric form, but it fails to convert character
vectors because of how these data types are internally represented.
Logical vectors consist of `TRUE` and `FALSE` values, which have
straightforward numeric equivalents: `TRUE` is converted to `1` and
`FALSE` to `0`. This simple binary nature allows `as.numeric()` to
perform a direct conversion. Similarly, factor vectors are stored as
integers under the hood, with each factor level corresponding to a
unique integer code. When `as.numeric()` is applied to a factor, it
retrieves these underlying integer codes, making the conversion to
numeric possible. In contrast, character vectors consist of text
strings, which have no inherent numeric representation. R cannot assign
a meaningful number to arbitrary text like “apple” or “dog,” so
`as.numeric()` fails to convert characters and instead returns `NA` with
a warning. This difference highlights why `as.numeric()` works for
logical and factor vectors but not for character vectors.

``` r
# Calculate the mean of logic vector again
mean_numeric_logical <- mean(numeric_logical)  # This will work, calculating the proportion of TRUE values

# Calculate the mean of character vector again
mean_numeric_character <- mean(numeric_character, na.rm = TRUE)  # This will return NA or an error due to NA values

# Calculate the mean of factor vector again
mean_numeric_factor <- mean(numeric_factor)  # This will work, but the result may not be meaningful

# Print the results
print(mean(df %>% pull(random_sample))) 
```
